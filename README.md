# GATO365-Canvas-Questions-Algorithm

## How to use the code: 

### Step 1: 
#### Put quiz questions into an .xlsx file with the following column names included: 'question_identifier', 'type_questions', 'points', 'question_stem', 'question_options', and 'answer'

### Step 2: 
#### Change all sections that say 'USER INPUT': set working directory, import .xlsx file, quiz title, time limit, max attempts, and write out .xml file name (at end of file)

### Step 3: 
#### Run the code.

### Step 4: 
#### Take the .xml file you create, place into a folder, and zip the folder (Canvas only accepts .zip files)

### Step 5: 
#### Go to your Canvas course. Go to settings (left hand bar). Click 'Import Course Content' (right hand bar). For content type select 'QTI.zip file'. 'Choose file'. Click 'Import' (do NOT check 'Overwrite assessment content with matching IDs).
